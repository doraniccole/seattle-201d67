## Warm Up

- Building a very simple calculator
  - Display a number ( starts at 0 ).

    - Input should take in a number given by the user.
    - 1 Button for adding, the value of the input to our number.
    - 1 Button for subtracting the value of the input from our number.

## Code Review

- 2 really big tasks
  - Increment a number for everytime a user clicks on an image
  - Randomly generate new Images

  - HTML 5 fancy stuff.
  - Ouputs shapes and other graphical all within a web browser.
